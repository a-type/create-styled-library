## Behaviors

Behaviors define pure interactions which can be applied to other components. Animations may make up the bulk of behaviors, but any component whose exclusive function is to provide an interaction which can be applied to any element should live here. The existence of behaviors is meant to encourage reuse of interactions, animations and other presentational behaviors to promote consistency.
